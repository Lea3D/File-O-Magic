## Notes

- **Disclaimer**: I'm just a random ADHD-equipped female from Germany, in a love-hate relationship with ChatGPT-4o, hoping it wonâ€™t gaslight me one day.
- **Development Status**: This tool is under "heavy development" *cough*, so errors may and will occur. It's probably broken AF, as I (ChatGPT) wrote it for messin' around with some Radarr movie directories.
